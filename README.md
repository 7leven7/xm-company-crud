# xm-company-crud

I have made an effort to complete everything on the checklist.
To run the project, it will be sufficient to execute "docker compose up." 
You can find the routes in the "router.go" folder. 
If you want to run Litner, you can first enter the "xm-company-crud-app-1" container,
execute the following commands:
docker exec -id xm-company-crud-app-1 sh
golangci-lint run
